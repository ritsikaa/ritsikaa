        <p> ON TYPOGRAPHY </p>
    
        <p> <span> typography </span> is a <span class="service"> service art,</span>  not a <span class="service"> fine art</span>, however pure and elemental the discipline may be.</p>
    
        <p> the graphic designer <span>today</span>  seems to feel that the <span>typographic </span>  means at his disposal have been exhausted. accelerated by the speed of our time, a wish for new excitement is in the air. <span class="“newstyles”"> “new styles”</span> </span>  are hopefully expected to appear.</p>
        
        <p> <span> nothing</span> is more constructive than to look the facts in the face. <span class="facts">what are they? </span>the fact that nothing new has developed in recent decades? the bore- dom of the dead end without signs for a renewal? or is it the <span> realization</span>  that a forced change in search of a “new style” can only bring <span> superficial gain?</span> it seems appropriate at this point to recall the essence of statements made by progressive typographers of the 1920s:</p>
    
        <p> previously used largely as a medium for making language visible, typographic material was discovered to have distinctive optical properties of its own, pointing toward specifically typographic expression. typographers envisioned possibilities of deeper visual experiences from a new exploitation of the typographic material itself.</p>
